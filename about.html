		<h2>About Us</h2> 
		
		<p>Jennifer Lowell served in the US Army as a Pilot in World War II. After 1945, 
		she left the military to pursue a career in the clothing industry. Her goal was to provide
		high quality and affordable clothing for the many women who served in the military. 
		Her designs are influenced by both her experience in the US Army and the Women's
		Contribution to the War Effort in World War II. To this day, her designs and 
		company expands throughout the United States carrying this tradition.
